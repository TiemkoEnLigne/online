<td class=narrctr >Desdemona, Doctor Mad, had a first studio experience with singer Bevinda – who introduced him to literary and theater man †Gilles Canuto, with whom a great complicity was established as regards literature, sport, theater or staging, raving about on impossible texts, writing improbable songs
