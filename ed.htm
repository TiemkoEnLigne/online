Before forming TIEMKO, we had decided with Eric to work on mutual compositions. We met regularly in the apartment he then occupied in Paris, rue Saint-Simon in the 7th arrondissement. Armed with a piano, a vibraphone and drums, we put together a number of tracks which we then recorded on a revox (I still have some of these pieces on tape). The experiment lasted for around a year...
This apartment (a vast duplex) had been the studio of his grandmother Sonia Delaunay, whom I had had the opportunity to meet a few years earlier in the company of Eric. There were all sorts of canvases made up everywhere... Most of them by Sonia Delaunay, but without a signature because they were most often preparatory works. I remember a canvas, a kind of big yellow spot which burst like a star, that stumbled on the piano and bothered me. Eric told me "You can fire that lousy shit"; "And whose lousy shit is this?" I asked him. "From Max Ernst"... he replied.
Eric was living on incomes from family assets.

<td class=narrctr>There is a large part of autobiography, discomfort (within relationships but also related to his childhood, and then his adult life - where he feels outside of traditional society), of feelings (Eric was very intuitive: he saw things right even if without any nuances), a more than pessimistic vision of what surrounds him; Eric doesn't cheat.

Apocalypse is a great achievement, an extraordinary song; the lyrics and the music are in perfect harmony on a background of dissonance (dissonance and uselessness of existence which contrasts with a martial beat: Eric was fascinated by war machines; some of his paintings have just tanks on them.
<i>Faut que je me demerde pour des pots cassés que je n'ai pas cassé et rempli de merde</i>
I must sort my shit out for broken pots that I didn't break – and are full of shit (awkard childhood then existence)
<i>Dans le monde qu'on vit et qui pue la gerbe, qu'est-ce qu'on peut bien foutre les pieds dans la merde</i>
In the world we live in, that smells of puke, what the hell can we do with our feet in shit (uselessness of existence)
Et que le bateau n'est pas à bon port
And that the boat is not safe (we're not going anywhere) – here my voice is along Eric's –
At the end, the guitar finds itself alone, without effect, with no way out... It scatters without any goal.
