What's told about Tiemko on Internet is sometimes stereotyped and resembles too often to copied quotes, like it happens too often on the Internet. One would read about a "very special use of dissonances" (Are there any dissonances that wouldn't be special ?),"led by a cataclysmic guitar" 
(I didn't know Rémy had affinities with the Apocalypse) and "unsettling keyboards" (sometimes they talked about dark keyboards — I hate the dark), (...)this all seems a bit simplistic to me - to be polite - even if simplier terms sometimes seem more accurate to me: originality, rhythmic inventiveness, personal and experimental concept, singular and inspired music, iconoclasm... I don't know if [any] interview mentions sung titles (from Clone) that I would very much like to rehabilitate. Diehard makers of dark and cataclysmic music would allegedly only produce instrumental titles; "Do you want to play commercial music ?" is what Musea told me on the phone, they never defended (it's even the opposite)
neither the originality of the music nor the lyrics of the songs there (which as everyone knows were all first in the charts...).</td>

<td class=narrctr>Long before Tiemko, guitarist Jean Marc Thiebaut was part of a first band (Phoenix) in which I was bass player; there were two others
guitarists (Philippe Bambuck and Vévé – because of this diminutive, I completely forgot his name –), Robert Kempler on keyboard (later to with Asia Minor) and of course Eric
on drums.

<td class=narrctr>Eric, then all of us, became friends with Jean-Michel Brière. A talented and original character to whom we owe, among other things,
the the cover of Clone (supervised by Eric). It was he who allowed us to be invited for a private concert, a big party (birthday)
the filmmaker for whom he was working at the time [Alain Tyr]; the latter in exchange made Tiemko's only video; not so unique as that, because there were
many in concert, all of which have disappeared: but that's another story...

<td class=narrctr>I knew him well, we worked on music after texts by him. He is or, he was, alas, an outstanding character I liked very much. I took lyrics by him on one song on Clone, one more that made Musea wince: Rock'n'roll Alice.

<td class=narrctr>Pip Pyle, this superb drummer(...), arrived after Tiemko thanks to Rémy. He was to play on my album "Travelling" ; we started to work together, then one month before going to studio, Pip RIP, if I dare this disastrous pun... Losing him was disastrous in all respects.
