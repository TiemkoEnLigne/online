<td class=narrctr>Jean-Marc Thiébaud had played keyboards on Eric Delaunay's solo album "Antagonisme"; he met Rémy Chauvidan, who'd become with Jean-Jacques Toussaint the only ones who'd fully agree on the band policy Delaunay had dreamt of. A first rehearsal would take place at the HBS studio (rue des Petites écuries). The band's name was chosen around a borscht served at the late restaurant "Tiemko" next to La Sorbonne. Tiemko would end up remaining a trio after auditioning several musicians esp sessions bassists, or keyboardists. Among others, Eric's acquaintance Robert Kempler (they'd met on the album Antagonisme) and former member of Asia Minor who'd give up their workspace called “the Station” several years later, for Tiemko to make it a real recording studio – but also the bassists Jean François Bouvier, and Jean-Jacques Kerléo who'd played with Rémy in a band. At the end of all those auditions it became obvious Tiemko would be born a trio.
 
The members of Tiemko would become loyal customers of La Pinte, a tavern close to the Odeon theatre, whose proprietor then offered jazz concerts featuring groups like Uzeb, ... so why not Tiemko !! – Past a certain hour he offered to drink mixtures of his composition. Although the group offered only one piece of jazz whose theme Toussaint had composed on purpose to fit to what was played there, the group had carte blanche. Delaunay played very loudly, to the extent an electronic drum was proven necessary in order to avoid concerts at a deafening volume.</td>

<tr><td class=title>1988 First album - Espace fini</td></tr>
<tr height=20px />
<tr><td class=narrctr>Back in 1987 Éric Delaunay, with some obscure funds, decided to take up productions by Tiemko. After a first recording at the HBS studio for a demo, the first album matured. In July 1988, JJ. Toussaint, had become a teacher, he'd teach archeology, an early passion he's also studied, later as a professor; he'd record during holidays, as well as pursuing regular activities as a musician. R. Chauvidan spent a very trying month recording the first album. At twenty-two, working as an electrician and with a jackhammer, then taking the train from his building site to the studio. "Chant transylvain du Sud-ouest tyrolien", made of vocals by JJ. Toussaint during a microphone test, was secretly recorded by sound engineer and musician Marc Rosenberg, known for his work with band Eskaton; the result would then be acclaimed by the trio. The CSTA studio being equipped with only 16 tracks, the electronic drums taking up half, possible additions were limited. The trio chose to record the following albums at the ADAM studio.</td></tr>

<td class=titre>1989-1993 Ocean, Parade and planning concerts</td>
<tr height=20px />
<tr><td class=narrctr>While recording these albums during the long school holidays. Tiemko decided to plan concerts despite the difficulty for the organizers to make sure the music's style would fit. Opportunities came in Brittany as Minimum Vital offered to play as the opening band. Thanks to members of band Halloween – members had become close after Bernard Gueffier, co-founder of Musea, had introduced its music to E. Delaunay. Tiemko performed in theaters : Nesle, Clavel(where according to Delaunay, Tiemko played their best concert in 1991 with Halloween), Salle Curiale in 1993 with the group Xaal, considered musically by Éric as a good concert, despite unfit connections to amplifiers, and the Trévise theater a week later, a last concert with lights and smoke that went up into Toussaint's nostrils, masking the keyboards, yet considered the best perf by Chauvidan.</td></ tr>

<tr><td class=narrctr>Musea manufactured and distributed Tiemko's first albums, also kept the last word on artworks. Océan's cover chosen by Tiemko would come across as (a slightly  thrashy fashion of) ECM's graphic style, was placed at the, well, "ass" of the disc. The drawings on the Parade booklet  by Delaunay would be told as they'd make believe Tiemko was medieval music, or told as being "raw" (perhaps in an exaggerated way in order to value another option), JJ. Toussaint spent a month to include them, eyerone ended up being pleased.</td></tr>
<tr height=20px />
<tr><td class=narrctr>Since the "Ocean" album, regular drums where mostly chosen, electronic drums returning only partially and on purpose in the other albums. Océan is presented as a composition for three, although Toussaint is the main author. A beginning of composition on which everyone came to graft then add their own ideas, and the long development which follows a "piece of bravery" on guitar invented and already played by Chauvidan at the Pint. This album includes an acoustic piece, (Bonbon très sucre) by Rémy Chauvidan, in an airy jazz atmosphere that contrasts and already predicts sonic surprises by Tiemko. It plays regularly on the airwaves and democratizes listening to Tiemko a little through a new audience.</td></tr>
<tr height=20px />
<tr><td class=narrctr>The Parade album, composed mainly of short pieces with a view to commercial opening, is of unprecedented diversity. The piece "Moment" (classical guitar and strings, R. Chauvidan) was dedicated to lyricist Gilles Canuto. "Hymne" (E. Delaunay) was dedicated to the poet, author, composer and performer Patrick Deny whom Eric had accompanied on drums on several occasions.</td></tr>

<td class=titre>1995 Clone: ​​recorded despite the decision to disband</td>
<tr>
<td height=30px></td>
</tr>
<tr><td class=narrctr>For the first time the band was on care of the artwork, where typos would be no more, as well as of the music. R. Chauvidan expressed the intent to leave Tiemko in December 1994, yet would take part of the planned recordings where all three would record in turn. Toussaint sought to discover a playful dimension that the very written music of Tiemko would not allow, while preparing new compositions. Clone would become to him the . Delaunay wanted to work for a project called Clones whose name would later evolve into DeBoCo. Musea distributed and covered the manufacturing costs of this album, though hardly ever promoting it. Connoysseurs would enjoy it as three musicians in the most succesful of French progressive rock bands were in charge of gathering a crew of their choice for the pieces : Jean Pascal Boffo, Gilles Coppin (Halloween) and Eric Delaunay (Tiemko).</td> </tr>
<tr height=20px />
<tr><td class=narrctr>The track In Memoriam is a rare example of a musical "exquisite corpse": a concept by Delaunay who composed a part, revealing only the last bars to JJ. Toussaint who'd compose the central part followed by the same bars from which R. Chauvidan would finish. This piece is also the only one by Tiemko where the three musicians have, so to speak, equally contributed.</td></tr>
