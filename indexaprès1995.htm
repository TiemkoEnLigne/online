<tr><td class=narrctr>Tiemko did not rule out reforming, but a nasty illness claimed Eric's life in July 1996 and prevented it for good. This left DeBoCo unfinished, Rémy completed the existing pieces as a producer and musician. In order to gain flexibility, also because Tiemko's disbanding, leaders would be on charge rather than bands : Eric Delaunay of course, Gilles Coppin (Halloween keyboardist), and Jean-Pascal Boffo – Thierry Payssan having finally renounced.

Each one of the three leaders would compose a non harmonized melodic line and submit it to the other two, summing up to nine pieces. A tenth, which would have been the synthesis (according to the principle of the "exquisite corpse") was the only one left uncomposed.
This successful project still remains today an appreciated item in the world of prog rock. Recordings in Brest, mixing in Metz, production in Paris and three different musical worlds confer to this album, a unique variety and richness.

<tr><td class=narrctr>R. Chauvidan et JJ. Toussaint remixed Espace Fini in 1998, each one of them comosing from a theme by Eric Delaunay they'd played à la Pinte but had not planned to record (Eric didn't like it !), finally Marie Grenon sung on a recording along with baryton Benoît Méjean, soprano Bévinda, drummer François Verly. En 2003 improvisation excerpts recorded in a rehearsal studio at rue Amelot back in 1994, along with a piece by JJ. Toussaint composed in 1996, were published on CD "Ça Tourne...", it has a 1990 live video by Alain Tyr, that seems to have remained the only one of that kind – several other VHS vids would be considered garbage when Delaunay's flat was emptied after he'd passed away – and an animation by Jean-Michel Brière on the piece named Clone.

<td class=titre>2006 Travelling</td>
<tr height=20px />
<tr><td class=narrctr>Toussaint's solo project Travelling has rare moments that'd remind of Tiemko. It has "Volutes", a piece by Rémy who presented him to Pip Pyle after rue St Maur, studio "La Station" en 1997 – rehearsals for Travelling with this musically and humanly most appreciable drummer, one month before  studio recording ! Drums were then played by excellent François Verly. As no concert is planned and Travelling don't depend on a fixed number of players, there's more room for instrumental variety and a broadened experimental field.
